### Go1 safety preparation for low-level control testing

Before connecting to PC, there are several setup steps to connect Go1 to the bracket with the wired connection:
1. Power on Go1 by pressing the battery button once shortly, and once long (3 seconds)
2. Suspend Go1 by pressing
  + L2+A
  + L2+A
  + L2+B
  + L1+L2+start (now Go1 should be suspended)
3. connect Go1 with the wired connection

### Legged SDK build and installation

Dependencies: 

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install liblcm-dev libmsgpack*
```
Go to Unitree legged sdk github repo <https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_legged_sdk/tree/go1>, git clone the repo with branch **go1**

```bash
git clone -b go1 https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_legged_sdk.git
```


### Remote connection 
Enable a host computer to communicate with Go1 using internet connection.

First, make sure the host computer and Go1 connect to the same WiFi. 

Next, check the IP addresses of the host computer and Go1 using 

```bash
ifconfig
```

For example, the IP address of the host computer would be `192.168.1.23`, and the IP address of Go1 would be `192.168.1.221`.

Then in Go1's terminal, add the IP address of the host computer as a static route to the routing table of Go1's Linux kernel using the following command:
```bash
sudo ip route add 192.168.1.23
```

Finally, check the connection by pinging their IP addresses. For example, to check connection from host computer to Go1, in the host computer's terminal:
```bash
ping 192.168.1.221
```

After these setup, we can happily use VScode's [remote SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) function to enable connection from host to Go1.


### Unitree Camera SDK

Dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libudev-dev xorg openbox freeglut3-dev
```
